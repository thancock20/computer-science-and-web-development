## Introduction - 5 Elements of Effective Thinking

1. **Understand Deeply:** Don't face complex issues head-on; first understand simple ideas deeply. Clear the clutter and expose what is really important. Be brutally honest about what you know and don't know. Then see what's missing, identify the gaps, and fill them in. Let go of bias, prejudice, and preconceived notion. There are degrees to understanding (it's not just a yes-or-no proposition) and you can always heighten yours. Rock-solid understanding is the foundation for success.
    * **Uncover the essence.** This involves identifying and ignoring all of the distracting features. This includes both obvious things like the setting of the problem and more subtle things that will come to light as you work on the problem. Spend some time getting to know the non-superfluous elements of the problem, and think about how they apply to the problem as a whole.
2. **Make Mistakes:** Fail to succeed. Intentionally get it wrong to inevitably get it even more right. Mistakes are great teachers - they highlight unforeseen opportunities and holes in your understanding. They also show you which way to turn next, and they ignite your imagination.
    * **Being Systematic.** Keep in mind that following through on an idea is important to learn more about the subtleties of the problem even if you know it is not the answer, but once you read a dead end, make it explicit *why* the path you took did not work in order to learn something from it. It might seem like a step backwards to start over, but if you know something you didn't know before, you really are closer to the answer. From here if you look at all the possible first steps, you can be confident one will lead to the correct answer. The more you learn about which types of answers are incorrect, the more possibilities you can rule out.
3. **Raise Questions:** Constantly create questions to clarify and extend your understanding. What's the real question? Working on the wrong questions can waste a lifetime. Ideas are in the air - the right questions will bring them out and help you see connections that otherwise would have been invisible.
4. **Follow the Flow of Ideas:** Look back to see where ideas came from and then look ahead to discover where those ideas may lead. A new idea is a beginning, not an end. Ideas are rare - milk them. Following the consequences of small ideas can result in big payoffs.
5. **The Quintessential Element:** The unchanging element is change - by mastering the first four elements, you can change the way you think and learn. You can always improve, grow, and extract more out of your education, yourself, and the way you live your life. Change is the universal constant that allows you to get the most out of living and learning.
