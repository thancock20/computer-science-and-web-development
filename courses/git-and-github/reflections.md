How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Seeing only the changes between a working version and a non-working version
    narrows the focus, to make it easier to spot the bug.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It would make it easier to find bugs that came in between versions,
    or allow you to easily return to an older version. Thus saving lots
    of time in the long term.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Automatic saving probably won't save exactly after each logical change.
    The only way to ensure this is to manually save.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
