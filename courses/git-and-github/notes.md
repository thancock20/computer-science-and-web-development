# Notes related to what I learned while completing this

To view the difference between two commits:

    git diff first-commit-id second-commit-id

How often to commit:
A good rule of thumb is to *make one commit per logical change*. For example,
if you fixed a typo, then fixed a bug in a separate part of the file, you
should use one commit for each change since they are logically separate.
