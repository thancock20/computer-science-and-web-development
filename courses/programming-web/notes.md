# Notes from Programming for the Web with JavaScript


Slides from videos are in the [Handouts folder](./handouts).

This course was mostly review of what I've already gone over on freeCodeCamp and elsewhere. Though it is good to go over it again, I did notice that the HTML section did not go over semantics at all.

Also, the homework had me build some components in React, and build an API using Node, Mongo, and Express; but it never combined the client and server side to use the full MERN stack.
